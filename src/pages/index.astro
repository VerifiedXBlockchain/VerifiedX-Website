            It is certainly confusing for the unfamiliar and even the moderately familiar. For starters we need
            technologies that reduce reliance on third parties and help solve everyday problems efficiently with reduced
            costs.

          <div class="py-2"></div>

            They should provide for seamless everyday interaction by anyone globally and not be reliant on centralized
            authorities to administer them or be based on economic status. Even so, third parties and builders should
            also be empowered to integrate them, with any individual user having the choice to move freely on or off any
            platform and reside completely natively without complication.

            Being permissionless, trustless, transparent, and self-sovereign should be as simple and instant as clicking
            a button… this should mean something, this should actually do more than just "something". It should empower
            us to manage our own assets freely, securely, and transact with anyone easily, not just rinse and repeat the
            same solutions with a different skin.

            or however you wish to classify Bitcoin, most can agree it has garnered initial critical mass and adoption

          <div class="py-2"></div>

          <p>
            with an in-wallet user interface. Governance is the reward for validating, rather than a block reward from
            mining activities or traditional staking. Why? Because reward structures for validators and mining
            infrastructures have proven to be parasitic and create an inflationary environment, which tend to not align
            with the best interest of a network and its community members. In many cases, they seem to favor the
            wealthiest of holders and / or the most dominant and are more pseudo- decentralized… not very different from
            some of the more traditional systems right?
          </p>
          <div class="py-2"></div>

          <h3 class="text-3xl text-primary">
            One can think of a VFX Validator similar to that of a Bitcoin Full Node.
          </h3>
          <div class="py-2"></div>

          <p>
            It doesn't generate any income from the network and its primary purpose is to verify transactions and
            contribute to the network's security. VFX takes this even further to ensure true altruistic decentralization
            by upholding a Zero Knowledge Proof of Assurance (PoA) consensus… anyone may join and become a validator at
            anytime, so long as they hold the minimum required native VFX coin in their non-custodial wallet using any
            machine with the minimum specs, a unique IP address, and run the wallet in validator mode.
          </p>
          <div class="py-2"></div>
          <p>
            There are no lockups or holding periods, it is that simple. As a tradeoff for the work a validator does, it
            immediately earns governance rights to put forth proposals, changes, enhancements, and cast votes all
            through the wallet with a 'one-click' interface, upholding a one CPU-one vote methodology.
          </p>
          <div class="py-2"></div>

          <p>
            The economic incentive here is by participating in helping advance the network and contributing to its
            growth. This is further enhanced with a truly deflationary native coin, where every transaction and network
            service fee is burned at the time of its occurrence creating additional rarity as utilization increases over
            time.

            Having access to a <span class="font-semibold">Switchblade</span> wallet is without a doubt a mainstream accelerator
            with simple password and login accounts without sacrificing on-chain security at all. In fact, <span
              class="font-semibold">Switchblade</span
            > is the first native layer 1 wallet in which a user can immediately participate in Defi, commerce, DePin, decentralized
            voting, tokenization, and storage without the need for a third party app or authority. It was built for everyday
            use and to solve everyday problems, the way it should be.
